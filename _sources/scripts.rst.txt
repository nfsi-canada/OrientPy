Scripts
=======

The program :mod:`~orientpy` is meant to be run using command-line scripts that
are described below. These can be used in bash scripts to automate data processing. 
These scripts use classes defined in :mod:`~orientpy` to process single-station
and single-event seismograms, which are then aggregated to generate a single 
estimate of station orientation per method. There are three methods with accompanying
scripts that can be used to determine station orientation, which are described below. 
All of them use a station database provided as a :class:`~stdb.StDb` dictionary.

``bng_calc_auto``
*****************

Description
-----------

Downloads three-component seismograms based on a catalogue of earthquakes 
and performs automated estimation of P-wave polarization. Station selection is 
specified by a network and station code. The database is provided as a 
:class:`~stdb.StDb` dictionary. This method can be used with teleseismic P-wave
data or regional earthquake data, by specifying the appropriate options accordingly.
Each usable station-event seismograms are used to calculate an estimate of station
orientation. For each estimate, a number of quality-control parameters are calculated
to help in the aggregation to produce a final estimate of station orientation.

This automated method will use the same processing parameters for all waveforms 
(e.g., time window around predicted P-wave arrival, bandpass frequencies, etc.).
Because the properties of individual seismograms can vary widely for different
earthquakes, a different script can be used in manual (interactive) mode to improve
the quality of the estimates (see below).

Description
-----------

Downloads three-component seismograms based on a catalogue of earthquakes 
and performs automated estimation of Rayleigh-wave polarization at a number of
periods and for the direct and complementary globe-encircling path. Station 
selection is specified by a network and station code. The database is provided as 
a :class:`~stdb.StDb` dictionary. Each usable station-event seismograms are used

is calculated and is used later in selecting which estimates are used in the final
estimate of station orientation.
